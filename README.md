# CloneZapper
CloneZapper is a Python script that hunts down identical files within a directory and its subdirectories, ruthlessly eliminating them! 

This script doesnt rely on files names, it compares files by checking their hash.

## Motivation
I had a whole bunch of music files from backups and on my hard drive. Many of these files were duplicates. I needed a fast way to remove duplicates and thats how this script was born.

## Installation & Usage

### Installation
Download a copy of the "clonezapper.py" file to the folder with the duplicates. The script will search for duplicates in the directory and all the subdirectories in that directory.

### Usage
```
python clonezapper.py
```
