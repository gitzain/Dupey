## Motivation
I had a whole bunch of music files from backups and on my hard drive. Many of these files were duplicates. I needed a fast way to remove duplicates and thats how this script was born.

## Installation & Usage

### Installation
Download a copy of the "Dupey.py" file to the music folder with the duplicates. The script will search for duplicates in all sub directories.

### Usage
TODO: Write usage instructions
